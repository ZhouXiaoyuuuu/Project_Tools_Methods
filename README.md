Topic: Level of popularity of Game of Thrones in different countries and areas

Reference: 
1) 'In these selected markets, Game of Thrones' home market of the United States does not have the most demand: the UK has nearly 8% more demand, India has 1.7% more demand, and Mexico has just 0.2% more demand. However, the US has more demand than many other markets, including 25% more demand than in China.'

2) 'Increased Accessibility: HBO has made an increased effort to market its original programming globally, and has invested time and money into ensuring that audiences in all territories can access their programming in ways that suit them. For example, Game of Thrones has been dubbed into several new languages across Asia over the past two years, making it easier for local audiences to understand, including Thai for the first time in 2017.'

3) 'Increased Marketing In Asia: Capitalizing on the show’s popularity, HBO has stepped up its marketing efforts across the region in recent years. Ahead of the season six premiere, actress Maisie Williams (Arya Stark) visited Japan and Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworth) went to Thailand to promote season seven. These efforts have resulted in the show breaking worldwide viewership figures for its season premiere just six weeks ago, with subsequent episodes easily pulling in more than 10 million viewers each week. Game of Thrones is likely to shatter those records again when the final episode of season 7 airs on Sunday, and when it does, Asia will play no small part.'
